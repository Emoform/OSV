# OSV
OSV: OSPF Vulnerability Checking tool

This is my graduation project, the paper is published on ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8025919/

Code written in python with the help of Scapy (https://github.com/secdev/scapy)

Please put the wordlist (.txt file) in the same directory with the OSV (.py) file while running the tool. In order to crack the MD5 or HMAC-SHA when the OSPF has enabled authentication.
