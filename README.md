# OSV
OSV: OSPF Vulnerability Checking tool

This is my graduation project, the paper is published on ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8025919/

Code written in python with the help of Scapy (https://github.com/secdev/scapy)
Please make sure that scapy is installed in your environment and their library can be pulled.

I normally run this tool in Ubuntu and Kali-Linux platform, haven't tried on Windows yet.

Please put the wordlist (.txt file) in the same directory with the OSV (.py) file while running the tool. In order to crack the MD5 or HMAC-SHA when the OSPF has enabled authentication.
